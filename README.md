- 👋 Hi, I’m @Goldenvikingsunset
- 👀 I’m interested in ...Microsoft Dynamics Business central
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...HTML, CSS and JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...Front end web development
- 📫 How to reach me ...paul.rennison1983@gmail.com
- I have been a Consultant for 3 years and am now teaching myself to code.
  I am starting with front end web development as it is well documented and there are plenty of resources around, and i know no programing languages.
  My plan is then to look at the back end and combine that with my Azzure studies.
  
  Why web development if i am a Business Central consultant ? well it is a web app now it has gone Saas,
  so i thought knowing more about these areas would improve my all round knowlage and improve my solutions,
  for Business central. (i'm thinking Azzure logic apps etc)
