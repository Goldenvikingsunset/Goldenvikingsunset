# 👋 Hi, I’m @Goldenvikingsunset

- 👀 I’m deeply interested in **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** and its ecosystem.  
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in **Azure**, **Power Platform**, and **Business Central extensibility** (AL programming, APIs, and integrations).  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **Business Central projects**, especially those involving **customizations, integrations, and automation** using tools like **Azure Logic Apps** or **Power Automate**.  
- 📫 You can reach me at **paul.rennison1983@gmail.com**.

I have been a **Business Central Consultant** for 7 years, and I am now complementing my expertise by learning programming and web technologies. My focus is to gain a deeper understanding of technologies that enhance the capabilities of Business Central in a SaaS-first world.

## Why Programming and Web Development?

Since **Business Central** is now a SaaS application, understanding web development and cloud technologies has become essential for creating innovative and robust solutions. Here's how I'm leveraging my learning:  

1. **Front-End Development**: Understanding the front-end helps me work with **Business Central APIs** and build interfaces that interact seamlessly with BC.  
2. **Back-End Development**: Learning **server-side technologies** complements my **AL programming** and allows me to create middleware solutions.  
3. **Azure Integration**: Studying **Azure Logic Apps**, **Azure Functions**, and **other cloud services** helps me design solutions that integrate BC with external systems.  
4. **Power Platform**: Combining **Power Automate**, **Power BI**, and **Power Apps** with **Business Central** to deliver low-code solutions.  

This holistic approach not only improves my technical skills but also enhances the quality of my Business Central implementations.
